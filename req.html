            in order to be in line with the Cookie law
            <br>
            Additionally, the banner itself contains a cookie that remembers that you've clicked the "got it" button and
            will not show again until cookies are cleared, if it does not show up simply open in Incognito mode or clear
            cookies

        <td>Validation of user input</td>
        <td>scriptSignUp.php validates input posted from the SignUp form, it contains 5 validation functions (1 for each
            field in order for the error messages to be relevant to each individual field) and a strip() function.
            <br/>
            Each validation function first checks whether the field is empty, if it is it throws the relevant error, if
            not, it strips the inputted data of whitespace and special characters in order to prevent XSS and SQL
            Injection attacks.
            <br/>
            For the email form it checks whether the data is in an email format using PHP's filter_var() function, and
            for the password it first checks whether the data for the password field equals the data for the password
            confirm field.
            <br>
            Finally, a regular expression is used on the password field in order to check it fulfils the password
            requirements as laid out in the &#12296;small&#12297; below the password field. this is achieved using PHP's
            preg_match() function
            <br>
            <br>
            scriptLogIn.php does much the same but on only two fields, email and password.
